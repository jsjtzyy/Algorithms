An algorithm to help efficiently count events (views, clicks) with much less memory(storage space)
This is an approximation algorithm

Scenario: how many distinct users have viewed a video?

Approach:  
 1. assign userId to each user:  64 bit long use id.
 2. 64 = 14 + 50
 3. creates 2^14 buckets, each bucket has 6 bit (can represent 0 ~ 2^6-1 = 63)
 4. The first 14 bits to determine which bucket to place
 5. For 50 bits, start from end to beginning and count how many 0s have been seen until meet the first 1
 6. Use # of 0s from step 5 and current value in bucket, select bigger one and update of necessary.
 7. If it's distributed system, merge 2^14 buckets from each server (picking the largest value from same bucket)
 8. compute avg of all buckets, the number of users is: ~2^avg
